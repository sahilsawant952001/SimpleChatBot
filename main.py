The procedures fit within the broader scope of a bank AntiMoney Laundering (AML) policy. KYC processes are also employed by companies of all sizes for the purpose of ensuring their proposed customers, agents, consultants, or distributors are anti-bribery compliant, and are actually who they claim to be. Banks, insurers, export creditors, and other financial institutions are increasingly demanding that customers provide detailed due diligence information. Initially, these regulations were imposed only on the financial institutions but now the non-financial industry, fintech, virtual assets dealers, and even non-profit organizations are liable to oblige.')

The user is supposed to enter all the personal details at the time of account registration. \n2) Upload an Evidence : After collecting information, in the second step, ask the user to upload a supporting piece of evidence as an identity proof. This helps the system verify that the user-entered information is not fake and holds authentic data. \n3) Verification of information : Once the user uploads a document as proof, the document template is identified and examined against several checks. It is to ensure the uploaded document is not tampered or photoshopped. Once itâ€™s validated, the data is extracted. There can be two ways to fetch the data from documents \n')
